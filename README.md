# stepwise-regression
Stepwise regression fits a logistic regression model in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic forward stepwise procedure. the stepwise selection process can be visualized and shows the saturation in terms of AUC. Furthermore it is possible to use early stopping to get an parsimonious model.
